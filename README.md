## Credits

The original _Power Racer_ game was created by _The Pit Crew_ in 2015. As part of the Computer Science curriculum at University of Basel, students create a Java based multiplayer game on a client-server architecture.
Benjamin Zumbrun, Simeon Jackman, Marco Leu and Florian Spiess originally created everything for this game on their own - code, sprites and sound. 
All credits belong to them.
